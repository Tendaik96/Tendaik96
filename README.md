I completed School Of Code bootcamp, a 16-week intensive bootcamp course to becoming a Full Stack Web Developer. I possess a strong foundation in vanilla JavaScript and JavaScript frameworks and have been honing my skills through self-study, personal projects. I am passionate about solving problems and building innovative
solutions, eager to leverage skills and knowledge to make an impact as a Junior Software Developer and I am excited to learn and grow in a professional setting.
